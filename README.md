In this project, we will analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for a flask based API that classifies disaster messages.

There are two data sets, one contains real messages that were sent during disaster events, and second is the categories that the message belong. We created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

This project includes a flask web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

Below are a few screenshots of the this web app:
