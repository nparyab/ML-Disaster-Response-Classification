<h1>Disaster Response Classification with ETL and Machine Learning pipeline</h1>

<img src="plots/covid_sk.jpg" width=%100 height=%100 class="center">


In this project, we will analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for a flask based API that classifies disaster messages.

There are two data sets, one contains real messages that were sent during disaster events, and second is the categories that the message belong. We created a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

This project includes a flask web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

This picture is the main page of the application that displays the input space for the message search. For instance, the message "There's a lack of water in Moleya, please informed them for me." is submitted.

In this next picture we will see how the categories of the message will look like
